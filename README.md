"Uber Ride Data Analysis". In this project, I analyzed trip data to uncover insights such as peak travel hours, most-used pickup locations, and weekday vs weekend ride patterns. I enhanced the dashboard with KPIs, charts, and heatmaps to make it visually informative and easy to understand for decision-making.
